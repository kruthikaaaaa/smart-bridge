# Smart Bridge Project

## Overview

This project is an Arduino-based Smart Bridge that automatically raises its height when flooding is detected.  
It uses a moisture sensor to detect water levels and a servo motor to lift the bridge.

## Components

- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motor
- Moisture Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Sunboard (for bridge structure)

## How it Works

1. Moisture sensor detects rising water.
2. Arduino reads the sensor and controls a servo motor.
3. Servo lifts the bridge automatically when flooding is detected.
